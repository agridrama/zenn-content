## Motivation
Why do we need to learn Network for distributed system?
The answer is simple. A distributed system is the system where its functions spread over network.

In general, non-functional aspect of systems often affect Quolity of Service (QoS), such as performance, scalability, reliability, availability and security.

Not all of above properties realte Network, but they are important when we think and build distributed system.

## Multi-Layered Network Architecture
There are two famous models.
OSI 7 layer model and TCP/IP 5 layered model


## Network protocols
For some specific application, like IoT and Sensor Network, knowledge on protocols is useful. On the other hand, TCP, UDP and IP is neccessary and suficient for most of ordinary systems.

Here I intorduce basic concept and difference between TCP, UDP and IP, but I would like to make an article about other network realted techonologies later.

## Socket stream

## Datagram
